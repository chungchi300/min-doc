# Introduction

A professional Senior full stack developer with sufficient experience on design & develop the large-scale web-based application. I enjoys being part of a successful and productive team. A thinker, writer, and craftsman. I spent 70% of my time in front end and 30% of my time in backend.

The most challenging front end project to me is KingMed Digital pathology program which is developed with react&redux to handle over billions of case each year. In this project we face a lot of performance challenging and we do lot of optimization to make it fast,secure and efficient.

The most challenging backend project which I done is bidflows which we combine 2 kind of real time tech(web socket and webrtc) to make virtual streaming auction feasible,scalable and convenient.We also adopt the secure&reliable multi-tenancy implementation in Nestjs since it is a SAAS product.

The most famous I do in day to day life is okibook which allows you book tables at good price in advance which the most challenging part is the limited developing time while having complex domain logic in inventory rule which is developed in a correct and quick way with our TDD approach.

Specialty: react, redux, front end optimization, node js,Program design, TDD, JS ,Nest Js, Cloud
